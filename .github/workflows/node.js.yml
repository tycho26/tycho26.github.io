        # This option allows you to define a private SSH key to be used in conjunction with a repository deployment key to deploy using SSH. The private key should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**. The public should be stored in the repositories deployment keys menu and be given write access.Alternatively you can set this field to `true` to enable SSH endpoints for deployment without configuring the ssh client. This can be useful if you've already setup the SSH client using another package or action in a previous step.

        # This is the branch you wish to deploy to, for example gh-pages or docs.
        branch: dev
        # The folder in your repository that you want to deploy. If your build script compiles into a directory named build you would put it here. Folder paths cannot have a leading / or ./. If you wish to deploy the root directory you can place a . here.
